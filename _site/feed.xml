Snacks and small plates are my favorite way to eat. My most beloved dishes are appetizers. When I have leftover ingredients or a craving, I “saladize” those apps!

Background
I enjoyed this video about go-to appetizers from Bon Appétit Test Kitchen Talks series. I was intrigued by the stuffed dates. I had the ingredients on hand, so I made them. They were fab, but I was the only one who loved ...

A process I developed at my last job. As technical program manager for the tools team, I needed to ensure we were focusing on the right work and seeing projects through to completion. Before this process, the team played whack-a-mole, targeting whatever new work popped up. There was no visibility into what the tools team was working on. There was no process to evaluate and prioritize incoming ...

When software development teams adopt agile methodologies, new conflicts can arise between the development and documentation teams. This is a post I wrote at my former job when a dev team told their technical writers that they no longer had time for documentation.

Agile development methodology is not anti-documentation. When discussing Agile and documentation, it is common to get hung up on t...
