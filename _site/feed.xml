Making maple syrup from our silver maples. The process of collecting maple sap and boiling it to make syrup is called sugaring. We’ve been sugaring since 2020.

My experience creating a free personal website using two popular options: WordPress.com and GitHub Pages.

This winter I built a personal website. Well, two (and a half) websites. There are many products and options out there, it can be overwhelming. Defining my requirements helped me focus my research:
