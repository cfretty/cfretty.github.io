  Continuation of drought. We were in extreme drought most of the season.
  Record number of air quality alerts.

Making maple syrup from our silver maples. The process of collecting maple sap and boiling it to make syrup is called sugaring. We’ve been sugaring since 2020.

Tap the trees &amp;gt; collect the sap &amp;gt; boil the sap &amp;gt; finish the syrup.

2023 sugaring by the numbers

My experience creating a free personal website using two popular options: WordPress.com and GitHub Pages.

This winter I built a personal website. Well, two (and a half) websites. There are many products and options out there, it can be overwhelming. Defining my requirements helped me focus my research:

Snacks and small plates are my favorite way to eat. My most beloved dishes are appetizers. When I have leftover ingredients or a craving, I “saladize” those apps!

Background
I enjoyed this video about go-to appetizers from Bon Appétit Test Kitchen Talks series. I was intrigued by the stuffed dates. I had the ingredients on hand, so I made them. They were fab, but I was the only one who loved ...

A process I developed at my last job. As technical program manager for the tools team, I needed to ensure we were focusing on the right work and seeing projects through to completion. Before this process, the team played whack-a-mole, targeting whatever new work popped up. There was no visibility into what the tools team was working on.
