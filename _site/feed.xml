Snacks and small plates are my favorite way to eat. My most beloved dishes are appetizers. When I have leftover ingredients or a craving, I “saladize” those apps!

Background
I enjoyed this video about go-to appetizers from Bon Appétit Test Kitchen Talks series. I was intrigued by the stuffed dates. I had the ingredients on hand, so I made them. They were fab, but I was the only one who loved ...

A process I developed at my last job. As technical program manager for the tools team, I needed to ensure we were focusing on the right work and seeing projects through to completion. Before this process, the team played whack-a-mole, targeting whatever new work popped up. There was no visibility into what the tools team was working on. There was no process to evaluate and prioritize incoming ...

The computer is great, but I did not know the mouse would make such a difference.

This October, I needed a new computer. I knew I would buy a laptop. After doing a bit of research, I settled on a Mac. I made this decision based on price and availability at my local Best Buy store. I am a tactile shopper, I need to see and touch a thing before I buy.

Update February 2023: I’m gonna try and let it grow and do something with the ends in a few months. Dye? Chop? Who knows. Stay tuned.
