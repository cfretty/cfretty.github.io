    "content": "The computer is great, but I did not know the mouse would make such a difference.Image by Tex Avery on Wikimedia CommonsThis October, I needed a new computer. I knew I would buy a laptop. After doing a bit of research, I settled on a Mac. I made this decision based on price and availability at my local Best Buy store. I am a tactile shopper, I need to see and touch a thing before I buy.Though I grew up using Macintosh computers, I am a PC and Android person. I struggle with Apples. But it’s good to learn something new, I reasoned. Also, my spouse uses Apples at work, and it would be a smoother experience for him to use the same operating system both at work and home. Years ago, we bought a refurbished school Mac laptop as our home computer. From time to time, trying to use that Mac almost brought me to tears. Why, for Pete’s sake, is there no right-click menu?Despite the bad past experience, I my mind was set on a MacBook Pro. The look and feel of it and its nice sale price sealed the deal. The sales associate at Best Buy was helpful, so I told him about my struggles with Macs as a PC person. As a PC guy, he empathized. He excused himself and returned with a mouse and an adapter. He was upselling for certain, but I mean, I need a mouse. I was only half listening as we walked to the register and he explained it was the “most PC-like mouse” available. I want to say that mouse has been the thing that has made this new MacBook experience far better than my last. Huzzah, there’s my right-click menu! And a scroll wheel! Thanks, Best Buy sales associate, for selling me the exact thing I wanted and also the exact thing I needed.ReferencesLogitech MX Anywhere 3 for Mac"
