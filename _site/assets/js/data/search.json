    "content": "Snacks and small plates are my favorite way to eat. My most beloved dishes are appetizers. When I have leftover ingredients or a craving, I “saladize” those apps!BackgroundI enjoyed this video about go-to appetizers from Bon Appétit Test Kitchen Talks series. I was intrigued by the stuffed dates. I had the ingredients on hand, so I made them. They were fab, but I was the only one who loved them, so what to do with the extra ingredients? I mean, a second and third round was a possibility, but for only me? Also, not really a quick and easy lunch. So I made a salad version instead. Simpler. Lovely.Will it salad?There are plenty of appetizers that you can “saladize” pretty easily. So, let’s play “Will it salad?”! For this game, I am talking about the leafy-green-garden salad vs the cooked-veg-or-chopped-proteins-and-cheeses-with-mayonnaise salad.In general, if the appetizer is made of mainly unprocessed ingredients, it’ll salad.Yes!Goat cheese stuffed datesThese ingredients are just as delicious and frankly, less fussy, in a salad. I like cold crunchy romaine lettuce for this, though peppery baby arugula is good too. Crumble the goat cheese instead of waiting for it to come to room temp and mixing filling. Make a honey vinaigrette with some chili or crushed red pepper if you’re feeling fancy, or drizzle over the top as Kendra shows in the video.Skip the salami or replace the salami with bacon. Switch out honey for Balsamic vinegar! Ooo! Now you’re getting into Devils on horseback territory.Olive dip or olive tapenade with cruditésOne of my go-to appetizers is a creamy mixed olive dip with parsley and lemon. The original recipe from Chowhound is no longer available (RIP Chowhound.com):cry:. So if you want this appetizer, you’ll have to invite me to your party.But the same idea would work with your favorite olive tapenade, too. Instead of processing those olives, roughly chop and throw in with the lettuce and the crudité vegetables, which are now cubes instead of sticks. Mix up a creamy or vinaigrette dressing, with or without anchovy paste or anchovies (Worcestershire is a fine sub). If you already have tapenade made, it’s the base of a lovely dressing.I mean, not a too much of a stretch to turn this one into a vegetarian Niçoise-style salad. Or not! Throw on that tuna! Add an egg!BruschettaI am not providing a recipe link here, but I am referring to the familiar tomato and basil on toast rounds.Caprese or panzanella anyone? More greens won’t hurt.Cowboy caviarSo I add jicama for crunch, forgo the chips and eat directly from the bowl anyway, but yeah, throw it on some finely shredded lettuce or Napa cabbage. Heck yeah, crumble some corn chips on top for croutons. Why not?… and I could go on and on. I’ll just leave a few more here: Buffalo wings, Spring rolls/Summer rolls, Shrimp cocktailNo!There are appetizers you cannot “saladize”. And why would you try?Oysters Rockefeller, mozzarella sticks, Hormel chili dip, pigs in blankets, sweet bacon wrapped smokies, hot spinach and artichoke dip, Top the Tater or your favorite sour cream based dip and chips.via GIPHYReferenceshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salad“Why Is a Salad Called a Salad When There’s No Lettuce?” by Jessica Furniss, allrecipes.comImage detail from Affiche Delftsche Slaolie on Wikimedia Commons"

    "content": "A process I developed at my last job. As technical program manager for the tools team, I needed to ensure we were focusing on the right work and seeing projects through to completion. Before this process, the team played whack-a-mole, targeting whatever new work popped up. There was no visibility into what the tools team was working on. There was no process to evaluate and prioritize incoming work requests.A little less Lucy and Ethel at the chocolate factoryThe Information Development DOCTOOLS team has formalized the work intake process. This will allow us to increase our efficiency, effectiveness, transparency, and consistency.Work intake refers to the process to create project proposals and get a go or no-go decision.Create a proposal (complete the work intake form)InfoDev Tools team uses Jira issue and project tracking software for all work intake.If you are proposing a work task, enhancement, or improvement for an existing or ongoing tool or project, create a DOCTOOLS Jira issue as always. Use the appropriate Issue Type and Component/s.If your proposal is for a new project, use the project proposal template.NOTE: The template will request only the information we need to make a decision. Information collected but not used is a drain on resources. If something is unclear or if we have questions, we will follow up with you.Definition of projectA project is the research for or creation of new tools or processes. If one or more of these points describes your work request, it is a project. Please use the project proposal template.  the work will involve two or more people from Info Dev and Translation  an architect or other InfoDev staff member must pause work tasks to do research or provide a work estimate  the work will take more than a few minutesHow to create a project proposal in Jira  In Infor Jira, open the DOCTOOLS project proposal ticket template.  Click More &gt; Clone+ or More &gt; Clone. The Clone+ option allows you to edit the body of the ticket.  Give the ticket a new Summary (title). Remove the [Ticket template] phrase.  Complete the Description. (Details and hints below).What to do if a project proposal Jira ticket is assigned to youReview the comments and complete the requested action. Likely this will be a request for more information or for clarification.When your action is complete and you have added your updates, assign the Jira ticket to Charity Fretty (or acting Program Manager).What happens to proposal Jira ticket after decision  Approve - add label “Approved” and leave it open. The Jira should be closed only after relevant work tickets are created and assigned.  Defer - add label “Deferred” and leave it open. The program manager is responsible for the backlog of deferred proposals.  Cancel - add label “Cancelled” and close the Jira.About the project proposal template (aka work intake form)Jira DetailsProject: Infor Documentation Tools (DOCTOOLS)Component/s: New Work is required. If this project is for existing component(s), you can also add them.

Is this project in line with Infor corporate goals, strategies, “big bets”? Is it aligned with Product Development growth strategies? Information Development goals or strategies? If so, which one(s)?Date needed: Required. What is the desired completion date for the project?Stakeholders  Point person: Required. Who is overseeing progress and answering questions as the team gets to work? This can be you as reporter/requestor, or it may be a Sponsor, business owner, or SME.  Sponsor: Required. Who in leadership supports and sponsors this project?  Audience: Required. Who is affected by or benefits from this project? Who is the intended audience(s)?  Project team: Optional. If you know or have requests for who in Global InfoDev and Translation should do this work, add them here.Roles and responsibilitiesInitiator - creates the project proposal by creating a Jira issue using the proposal template to the best of their ability. Anyone can use the template to write a proposal, including staff, project managers, sponsors. Staff, including architects, may start a proposal for someone else and reassign to that individual for completion.Governance committee - reviews the proposal and make one of three decisions: approve, defer, cancel.  The governance committee is the team responsible for InfoDev strategic decisions. This team handles project selection, prioritization, and resource allocation. They will review the proposal and evaluate how the proposal aligns with department or corporate strategy. If the decision is “approve”, they will begin discussions to assess priority and effort of the proposal.Program Manager - reviews proposals to determine if they fit the guidelines for the intake process and facilitates the review process with the governance team. If a proposal does not meet criteria or it can be addressed via existing project or process, the program manager will reassign, close, or return the Jira ticket to the initiator. The program manager is responsible for the backlog of deferred proposals.Team members(s) - as needed, staff will be asked to review and comment on the proposal before it goes to the governance team. Including, but not limited to, architects, IT, translation, information developers.Process flowAdapted for Infor Global InfoDev from “PPM 101: How To Create A Successful Work Intake Process” - T Washington, Acuity PPMTimetablesProject proposals can be submitted at any time. Make sure your request is addressed in a timely manner, be sure to assign the proposal to Charity Fretty.DOCTOOLS Jira project is monitored daily by InfoDev architects and staff.Architects and the program manager review proposals and work requests at a check-in meeting every other Tuesday.The governance committee meets every other Thursday (opposite weeks of architects and program manager check-in).Architects and program manager meet once a month on for a long format project review.Metrics  Consider capturing a few key metrics for the work intake process:How many project requests originate from a given organization (e.g. Finance, Operations, Marketing, etc.). When the organization understands where its requests are coming from, it can take action to better meet the needs of those internal organizations.How many proposals are incomplete?How many proposals come in per week? Per month? Per quarter? This information can inform how often decision makers need to meet and for how long; it can also support annual planning processes.“PPM 101: How To Create A Successful Work Intake Process” - T Washington, Acuity PPMReferencesAgile Manifesto“Agile Development Methodology and Documentation: To document or not to document?” - Nuclino“IA Design and Agile Development: Mission (Im)possible!” - A Swope, DITA Strategies"

    "content": "When software development teams adopt agile methodologies, new conflicts can arise between the development and documentation teams. This is a post I wrote at my former job when a dev team told their technical writers that they no longer had time for documentation.Agile development methodology is not anti-documentation. When discussing Agile and documentation, it is common to get hung up on the Agile Manifesto’s software over doc value:Individuals and interactions over processes and tools :point_right: Working software over comprehensive documentation :point_left: Customer collaboration over contract negotiation Responding to change over following a planA couple of points:  “Documentation” is documentation in the broadest sense, including traditional internal development deliverables such as Systems Requirements, Systems Design, Vision and Scope, use cases, schemas, work-flow diagrams, Rational Unified Process artifacts, and so on. Do not confuse with user documentation.  The very next line of the manifesto is: “…While there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.” In other words, there is value in comprehensive doc. Do not eliminate all documentation. Instead, it’s more like: what’s the least amount of deliverable that we need right now.Teams will interpret this value and execute any number of ways, but here are some ideas:  Deliver working software first, comprehensive user documentation later. Deliver in later cycles, just in time, and iteratively. Assume the correct time for the user doc is later than “in active development.” Add docs as a feature request and prioritize the backlog.  Ensure at a minimum there are user stories in place. This can be the base for internal and customer-facing doc.Questions and comments for teams having the “working software over comprehensive documentation” discussion:  Doc team, are we embracing agile values and principles? No one adopting agile will listen if you reject these values and principles outright. Are we figuring out ways to work faster, smaller, and iteratively? Can we learn how to work with slimmed down, “just barely good enough” and “just in time” internal doc/info/artifacts? That may mean evaluating and letting go of processes, deliverables, schedules, and so on that no longer serve us.  Dev team, how does providing the resources necessary to create quality user documentation, for example, internal artifacts or developer/BA/QA time, impede the “working software” side?  Doc team, what is the minimal viable deliverable we need from dev to do our work? What do we need? When do we need it? Who creates it (BA, Product Management, or ?)?  Dev and Doc teams, can we agree on what makes up “just barely good enough” and “just in time” artifacts for stakeholders?  Dev team, remember principle 1: “Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.” If the customer expects user documentation or does not know about the value (functionality) the software delivers, are we truly satisfying the customer and thus meeting our highest priority?  All team members, consider principle 12: “At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.”ReferencesAgile Manifesto“Agile Development Methodology and Documentation: To document or not to document?” - Nuclino“IA Design and Agile Development: Mission (Im)possible!” - A.

    "content": "The computer is great, but I did not know the mouse would make such a difference.This October, I needed a new computer. I knew I would buy a laptop. After doing a bit of research, I settled on a Mac. I made this decision based on price and availability at my local Best Buy store. I am a tactile shopper, I need to see and touch a thing before I buy.Though I grew up using Macintosh computers, I am a PC and Android person. I struggle with Apples. But it’s good to learn something new, I reasoned. Also, my spouse uses Apples at work, and it would be a smoother experience for him to use the same operating system both at work and home. Years ago, we bought a refurbished school Mac laptop as our home computer. From time to time, trying to use that Mac almost brought me to tears. Why, for Pete’s sake, is there no right-click menu?Despite the past, my mind was set on a MacBook Pro. The look and feel of it and its nice sale price sealed the deal. The sales associate at Best Buy was helpful, so I told him about my struggles with Macs as a PC person. As a PC guy, he empathized. He excused himself and returned with a mouse and an adapter. He was upselling for certain, but I mean, I need a mouse. I was only half listening as we walked to the register, and he explained it was the “most PC-like mouse” available. I want to say that mouse has been the thing that has made this new MacBook experience far better than my last. Huzzah, there’s my right-click menu! And a scroll wheel! Thanks, Best Buy sales associate, for selling me the exact thing I wanted and also the exact thing I needed.ReferencesLogitech MX Anywhere 3 for MacImage by Tex Avery on Wikimedia Commons"

    "content": "Now that it’s been a year, I want to share my experience with dye-strip technique to transition to gray hair.Update February 2023: I’m gonna try and let it grow and do something with the ends in a few months. Dye? Chop? Who knows. Stay tuned.I can do nothing about the fact I am aging. So I have decided to lean in to my transition to crone (or swamp witch). (My new identity varies, based on my current mood.)A natural dark brunette who has had gray hairs since my twenties, I resemble my grandmother who went totally and beautifully white in her thirties.I have attempted and failed to go gray a few times over the years, for example:  Over a decade ago I stopped dying, aka the “cold turkey” method. This lasted a few months until my sister pointed at the crown of my head and said: “What’s going on there?”. I noped right back into my colorist’s chair. Not ready.  Five years ago, my colorist tried to transition me to ash blonde. It was a lovely color, but oh, I hated what the bleach did to the condition of my hair. My coarse hair felt like straw and fell out of my head by the handful. After several months, I backed out.I missed an opportunity at the start of the pandemic to begin the transition to gray, but I had plenty of time to research ways to embrace the gray.I found a method called the dye-strip technique. You dye only a single, narrow strip of hair along your side-part, and allow the rest of your head to grow in gray. Color about 1/4 inch (6 mm) on either side of your part, more or less, front to back. The narrow dyed strip is enough to cover up most of your head, including the awkward grow-out underneath. When your gray hair has grown, switch your part to the other side. Stop dying, and allow the last dyed section to grow out. It is now covered by your natural gray hair.December 9, 2021 was my last all-over dark brunette dye. I joined a gray hair support group on Facebook. In January, I made a plan with my colorist.Now that it’s been a year, I want to share my experience with the dye-strip technique. I have made it pretty far, and this might be it. A rule of thumb with hair growth is “a year to your ear” and that rings true with my experience.This attempt might have worked, but it hasn’t been as smooth as I wished.Once or twice my colorist colored a strip of hair far wider than necessary, like nearly half my head. I don’t know why, likely out of habit or because she was unfamiliar with this process. The result was more brassy calico coloring on that side once the area began to fade.My colorist felt guilty charging for a full color when she was only doing a narrow strip. This caused her more angst than me. In my opinion, the effort and processing time was the same. So while it took her less time to apply, the amount of work was the same for her. If I had it to do over, I would’ve tried dying the strip myself. If you’re like me and not comfortable dying your own hair, recognize this could be an issue and discuss with your stylist. Can they offer a discount for less product used, or skip the blowout and style?All dyed hair fades to orangey (dark browns, blacks) or brassy (blondes) tones. The top layer near my face on both sides is more damaged, so these show the worst of the brassiness of the last of my dye.While growing out gray hair from dyed, it is common to have several colors going on at once: the old dye color, the new white or silver (salt), new dark (pepper), orange or brass from fading color. You can look quite like a calico cat. My calico effect was bad in September (month 9). To help soften the effect, my colorist bleached baby highlights at my demarcation line and applied a deep ashy toner. It was lovely until the toner faded.From now on, we will tone only, no more strip, no highlights. I hope to manage by using toners and cutting my hair as short as I can bear. I want to be rid of the old dyed ends as soon as possible.References@silver.is.the.new.black on InstagramDiana Moffitt’s video with Katie Goes Platinum which explains the techniqueThe Gray Book - inspiration for going gray -  Facebook group   new (dyed) part on top, old part on bottom)Photo by Louis-Claude Vassé on Wikimedia Commons"
