<!-- excerpt -->
*The summer of 2023 was about change.*

* Different sun exposure after the removal of eight mature trees in 2023, including six green ash killed by [emerald ash borer](https://anokamunicipalutility.com/709/Emerald-Ash-Borer-EAB). (We saw our first adult EAB June 2022, the trees were more than 50% dead by December 2022.)
* Continuation of drought. We were in extreme drought most of the season.
* [Record number of air quality alerts](https://www.pca.state.mn.us/news-and-stories/air-quality-alerts-record).

# 2023 harvest by the numbers
* **apples** none (Hat Trick espalier, planted April 2021)
* **berries** about two cups of juneberries, a handful of strawberries and blueberries, about two gallons of raspberries
* **cucumbers** last week of July
  - 35 pint jars of pickles
* **herbs** gobs and gobs (I don't know, just a lot)
* **peppers** too many to count
* **tomatillos** mid-August
  - 3+ gallons in the freezer for verde
  - one batch of brilliant [guacamole](#recipe-tomatillo-guacamole)
* **tomatoes** first week of August
  - 30+ pint jars of salsa
  - 20+ pint jars of pasta sauce
  - 6+ gallons in freezer for processing in winter
  - tomato sandwiches: too many to say

# What went well
* We didn’t mow and let the lawn go dormant early to save water. It eventually rained enough for the lawn to come back, still avoiding mowing.
* Tomatoes, peppers, and herbs don’t seem to mind drought.
* Trays of fresh water and sacrificial volunteers in the yard helped keep critters out of the garden beds.
* Efforts to control Japanese beetle grubs are working, we only found a few. The raspberries, hops, apple and linden trees had little damage this year.
* Avoided #peppergate2023 #jalepenogate2023 by starting most hot peppers from our own seeds. 
* Wisconsin Lakes sweet pepper is a winner. 

# What went wrong
* The back corner of the lot where trees were removed was overrun by invasive plants and weeds. They crowded out keeper plants, extra tomatoes, and rhubarb. Creeping bellflower battles have begun.
* We allowed our young juneberry (aka serviceberry or Saskatoon berry) to get stressed during the heat of summer. Unclear if we can save it.
* Asparagus was not productive, either soil is too poor or the area is too shady.

# What did we learn
* Oregano is not only a perennial, it can get out of control if not actively managed.
* Disturbed garbage soil will grow all sorts of nasty things and you will get overwhelmed.
* Red shiso (aka perilla) grows astoundingly well in our yard. The seeds from a few decorative planters in ’22 resulted in many plants all over the yard, some as tall as three feet. I may live to regret letting it go feral, but this year I love it.

# How should next summer play out
* We will give our raised beds a break from nightshades. Though we haven’t had blight or other issues, it’s time for a break. What to plant is TBD. That is what winter is for.
* Understand the new sun exposure patterns and draw a map so we can make a plan. Top priorities: new home for asparagus.
* Get a handle on the noxious weeds early and remain vigilant.
