*Making maple syrup from our silver maples: Tap the trees > collect the sap > boil the sap > finish the syrup.*

# 2023 sugaring by the numbers
* **10 days** from tap day to boil day
* **10 hours** to boil and finish
  - Warming inside started at 10 a.m. and it took 40 minutes to get pots up to temp to move outside.
  - Syrup processing was done at 8 p.m.
* **10 cups** of syrup, in jars and ready for cooking, baking, and cocktails
  - Started with approximately 15 gallons of sap (we collected another gallon + on boil day).

# Review
This winter (2022-23) was snowy. Like [third-snowiest-winter-on-record snowy](https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/climate/journal/snowy-winter-2022-23.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, though we had milder than normal temperatures. 

The process of collecting maple sap and boiling it to make syrup is called sugaring. We've been sugaring since 2020. Weâ€™ve had poor timing for collecting sap in previous years, but we managed to do ok this year.

## Tap the trees
March 1, I posted on a local gardening Facebook page asking if it was time to tap in the Twin Cities metro. Predicted daytime temperatures were above freezing. Most replies said wait for temps in the 40s Fahrenheit during the day, freezing overnight.

March 15, we tapped our two giant front-yard silver maples with two spiles each, though they are big enough to support three. High temp on March 15 was 42 degrees F, and the sap was definitely running. 

### Tapping notes:
* Prefer the south side of the tree this is getting difficult due to previous tap holes
* Above a large root or below a branch too much snow to see roots, but we did try to place under branches
* 2 to 4 feet above ground-level deep snow made this hard to judge
* 6 inches from previous taps though the trees are large, it's getting harder to avoid old tap holes

## Collect the sap
### Collecting notes:
* Collect in sap bags, which we sanitize before using. 
* Empty the bags daily, or more if needed, into sanitized 5-gallon food-grade buckets. 
* We store the covered buckets in a cold garage until we have enough to make it worth the effort to boil.

The week of March 20 was warm and by Saturday, March 25, we had approximately 14 gallons, enough to boil.

## Boil the sap
We invited our urban-farmer friends over to show them the process. Luckily it was a nice spring day. It was a fun, if long, day. 

### Our boiling process
We boil the sap outside on outdoor propane burners.
1. Boil a pot of water inside on the range and note the temperature. It will be somewhere around 212 degrees F, but not exactly. Write it down and add 7.1 degrees, this is the boiling point of maple syrup and your target temperature.
2. Filter the sap from the bucket into the pot. We use a home brew sieve, but cheesecloth would work.
3. Warm the sap on the range to a boil or near inside and then move to outside burners to boil off.
4. Continue to filter and warm the sap indoors, a few quarts at a time, and add  it to the outdoor pots. Try to keep a continuous boil outside.
5. Once the sap evaporates down and the color is golden, consolidate into one large pot outside.
6. Check the temperature. When the temperature is above the boiling point of water, move the party inside to the range to finish. 

### Boiling notes:
* Make sure you have enough propane to run burner(s) for several hours.
* Boiling sap generates a huge amount of sticky steam, this is why you would not want to do this inside your home.
* The wide and shallow aluminum pots used for outdoor fish fryers are perfect for boiling.
* The burners will leave soot on the outside of your pots. Use old pots you don't care about, and be prepared to clean them. I recommend washing in the laundry sink with Dawn and a green scrubbie or Chore Boy, use rags to dry.

## Finish the syrup
It's easier to monitor and control finishing on the stove top. Once the syrup comes to the correct temperature, it is ready to filter again and jar. I don't know if it is necessary, but we use a water bath canner and process the syrup for 5 minutes. That is a whole other bunch of equipment, water, and steam, but safety first.

### Finishing notes:
* Finishing syrup will still generate a great deal of sticky steam. 
* If you are canning, take into account the amount of time it takes to bring water to a boil, sanitize jars and lids, and so on.
* If you have one, set a candy thermometer to 7.1 degrees F above boiling point of water and place it in your finishing pot.

### Cocktail recipe: Mother Lode
*A mapley version of a Gold Rush, christened by my Pops in honor of our silver maples and the lake we live on, Silver Lake.*

Ingredients
* 2 ounces bourbon
* 3/4 ounce lemon juice, freshly squeezed
* 3/4 ounce maple syrup

Steps
1. Add the bourbon, syrup, and lemon juice into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.
2. Strain into a chilled rocks glass over one large ice cube or shake and strain into a chilled coupe if you're fancy.
3. Optional. Garnish with a lemon twist.
