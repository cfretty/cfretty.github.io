<!-- excerpt -->
*The summer of 2024 we gave the beds a rest.*

* As planned, we gave our raised garden beds a rest from nightshades.
* Wet, wet, wet spring and early summer, followed by drought conditions.

# 2024 harvest by the numbers
* **apples** none (Hat Trick espalier, planted April 2021)
* **berries** birds beat us to the juneberries, a few strawberries and blueberries, about two gallons of raspberries
* **cucumbers** none planted
* **herbs** some transplants from last year in the bed
* **peppers** very few, a few in pots drown in early summer and never recovered
* **tomatillos** none
* **tomatoes** a few starts placed on lot line to take advantage of sun, left to their own without much attention, we did get some fruits
* **radishes** planted and grew well, but none for eating
* **wheat** wheatgrass as "green manure"
* **green beans** two gallons fresh and two cups dried beans

# What went well
* Tomatoes directly in the ground did OK, considering they received very little attention
* Feral, volunteer red shiso created a nice thicket in the back
* Rhubarb was very happy this year 

# What went wrong
* Creeping bellflower battles continue
* Morning glory seeds turned out to be bindweed, so we battled that most of the summer, huge mistake

# What did we learn
* It's very hard to dig up all the creeping bellflower, even in a small area; continue to do the best we can and be sure to pull them before the go to seed
* Seed packets can be wrong, I think we'll be fighting the bindweed for a long while now

# How should next summer play out
* We had a garden consult for the back corner of our yard, we will use her plan for back corner
* Keep on the noxious weeds
