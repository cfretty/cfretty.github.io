# 2024 sugaring by the numbers
* **6 days** from tap day to boil day
* **4 hours** to boil and finish
  - Warming inside started at 10:20 a.m.
  - Syrup processing was done at 2:30 p.m.
* **5 cups** of syrup, in jars and ready, which matches 2023 ratios of sap to syrup

# Review
Boy howdy. What a dumb [non-winter winter](https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/climate/journal/lost-winter-2023-24.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} it was. Zero stars.

I heard many folks tapped their trees in January. We figured we missed our chance and decided to skip it this year. But we had a change of heart when we discovered a dwindling supply of syrup in our cellar and a free weekend.

Boiling seems feels like it will be a lot of work, but once you get started it isn't bad. And what else are you gonna do on an early spring day when you can't garden or play? It's a good excuse to hang outside and get a little vitamin D.

## Tap the trees
On February 25, we tapped both silver maples. One spile each. We collected sap for only three days. Daytime high temps were right: 45, 52, and 41 degrees F. Nighttime lows were not ideal: 37, 30, 39 degrees F.

### Tapping notes:
* Tap above a large root or below a branch. No problems with this, no snow.
* Timing was ok, not perfect.
* See original [tapping notes](/posts/sugaring-retro#tapping-notes).

## Collect the sap
From Sunday to Tuesday, we collected 7.5 gallons and called it.

### Collecting notes:
* Two buckets. 
* We stored the covered buckets in a cold garage until we had time to boil.
* See original [collecting notes](/posts/sugaring-retro#collecting-notes).

## Boil the sap
March 3 was a good weather day. Sunny and breezy, but not enough to blow out the burners.

### Boiling notes:
* Three propane burners.
* See original [boiling process](/posts/sugaring-retro/#our-boiling-process) and [notes](/posts/sugaring-retro/#boiling-notes).

## Finish the syrup
As always, we used a water bath canner and processed the syrup for 5 minutes.

### Finishing notes:
* See original [finishing notes](/posts/sugaring-retro/#finishing-notes)

### Cocktail recipe: Trees Knees
*A mapley version of a Bees Knees. I can't take credit for the name. I love it so I'm using it.*

Ingredients
* 2 ounces gin (I suggest [Vikre Boreal Cedar Gin](https://www.vikredistillery.com/all-spirits/boreal-cedar-gin){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} or [Norseman Norseman Strength Gin](https://norsemandistillery.com/norseman-strength-gin-12318){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"})
* 3/4 ounce lemon juice, freshly squeezed
* 3/4 ounce maple syrup

Steps
1. Add the gin, syrup, and lemon juice into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.
2. Strain into a chilled rocks glass over ice or a chilled coupe if you're fancy.
3. Optional. Garnish with a lemon twist.
