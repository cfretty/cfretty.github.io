Half the original recipe. Double for parties.

As with pimento cheese spread (and most everything else) freshly grated cheese works best.

## Ingredients
- Cream cheese, softened - 4 oz
- Beer-flavored beer - 3 T (double is â…“ cup)
- Ranch salad dressing or ranch seasoning mix - .5 oz (double is 1 envelope)
- Shredded cheddar cheese - 1 cup

## Directions
In a bowl, beat the cream cheese, beer and seasoning mix until smooth. Stir in the cheddar cheese.
