I got one of those fancy Kitchenaid bread bowls for Christmas. The inaugural loaf using the recipe in the manual had a good crust and texture, but it didn't have much flavor. This recipe is pretty tasty and not too complex.

## Ingredients
Starter
- Bread flour - 3/4 cup
- Rye flour - 3/4 cup
- Honey - 3 T (or use 2 T honey + 1 T molasses)
- Lukewarm water - 1 1/2 cup (review yeast package for temperature)
- Instant yeast - 1/2 tsp

Flour mix
- Bread flour - 2 1/2 cups
- Caraway seeds - 2 T
- Salt - 2 tsp
- Instant yeast - 1/2 tsp

Also
- Vegetable oil - 1 T plus more to grease bowl (Optional. See notes about using the Kitchenaid bowl)

## Directions
1. Add the starter ingredients to a large warmed bowl (bread bowl), mix until smooth. Set aside for 10 minutes for the yeast to activate.
1. While the starter is resting, whisk or mix the flour mix ingredients - bread flour, caraway, salt, and instant yeast.
1. Pour the flour mixture over the starter but do not stir. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a clean towel and set aside for at least two hours and up to five hours. The starter will bubble up through the flour.
1. Add the oil to the flour mixture and use a wooden spoon or your hand to mix flour into the starter and make a shaggy dough.
1. Move dough to a lightly floured work surface or the mixer with the dough hook and knead until smooth and elastic (10 minutes-ish by hand). The dough may be sticky, knead in just enough extra flour to keep the dough from sticking to your hands. If it doesn't come together, may need more water (see notes).
1. Set the dough aside to rest for about 10 minutes, then knead again (5-10 minutes if kneading by hand).
1. Set the dough in a large, lightly oiled bowl and coat the dough. If using the bread bowl, use flour instead of oil. Cover with plastic wrap or a clean towel and set aside to proof until doubled in size, about 1.5 to 2 hours.
1. Remove the dough to a lightly floured work surface. Punch down the dough and lightly knead it 3 or 4 times. Form it into a ball, return it to the bowl, cover and let it rise for another 45 minutes or so.
1. Form the ball into a boule and set it on parchment or a baking mat. Lightly oil the top of the dough and cover it with plastic wrap. Set aside to rise for another hour.
1. Place the oven shelf to the lowest level and preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Add a pan if you will steam.
1. Use a sharp knife or a lame to slash the top of the dough. Try three across and down in a crisscross pattern.
1. Optionally mist the dough with room temperature water.
1. Place the dough on a baking sheet in the oven or use the bread bowl. 
  * If on a baking sheet, add about 1 cup water to the pan to create steam. Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce heat to 400 degrees F and bake another 35 to 45 minutes (190 degrees on instant-read thermometer).
  * If in the bowl, bake covered for 15 minutes, reduce heat and bake for 25. Remove the bowl for the final 10-15 minutes (to 190 degrees F).
1. Set on a cooling rack and cool completely.

## Notes
When using Kitchenaid Bread Bowl, use flour instead of oil to prevent sticking. Remember to remove the bowl from the base for the last 10 minutes of baking.

When using Baker's Field flour, it may need more water.
