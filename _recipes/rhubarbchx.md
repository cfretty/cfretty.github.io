Four servings (original recipe, halved). Add rhubarb at the end to retain the flavor and texture.

## Ingredients
- Bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs - 4 (about 1.5 lbs)
- Salt
- Fresh ground black pepper
- Olive oil (optional) - 1 Tbsp
- Shallot, finely chopped - 1 medium
- Fresh ginger, finely chopped - 1 Tbsp
- Ground cardamom - .5 tsp
- Dry sherry - .25 cup
- Chicken stock - .5 cup
- Honey - 2 Tbsp
- Orange juice, fresh squeezed or whatever you have - 2 Tbsp
- Rhubarb, medium dice - .5 lb

`*`Consider doubling the sauce.

## Method
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F, rack in middle. Pat the chicken dry, salt and pepper generously.

Heat the oil in large, heavy-bottomed, ovenproof pot or pan. (Or skip the oil, chicken gives off enough fat IMO.) Sear thighs over medium-high heat, skin side down, til golden, about 5 minutes. Flip and cook til golden, about 4 more minutes. Sear in batches if making more than 4. Transfer thighs to a plate.

Reduce heat to medium and remove all but 2 Tbsp fat form the pot. Add shallot, ginger, and cardamom, season with salt and pepper, and saute until shallot softens, about 2 minutes. Deglaze with the sherry and reduce to about half, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add the chicken stock, honey, and OJ and stir to combine. Return the chicken and juices to the pot, turn the chicken to coat and bring the mixture to a boil (thighs should end up skin side up).

Place the pot in the over and cook until the sauce is bubbling aroudn the sides and the chicken is no longer pink, about 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and scatter the rhubarb between and around the chicken (not on top). Return the pot to the oven until the rhubarb is knife tender, about 15 minutes.

Serve with crusty bread or a grain side to sop up the sauce.
