I make half batches. Try doubling the booze. Marshmallow to cereal ratio is high. Depending on your preference, you may want to try reducing mallows or increasing the amount of cereal.

## Ingredients
- Butter, salted - 2 sticks (1 cup) plus more for greasing the pan
- Mini marshmallows, divided - 3 12-oz bags
- Bourbon - ¼ cup (half is 2 T, or 1 fl oz if using a jigger)
- Vanilla extract - 1 T
- Kosher salt - ¼ tsp
- Rice Krispies or similar - 10 cups (one 12 oz box)
- Flaky sea salt, to garnish

## Directions
1. Grease a 9x13 baking pan with butter and set aside.
1. In a very large pot (light color is easier), melt butter over medium-high heat. Stir constantly until the milk solids start to brown and the butter smells nutty and darkens. This will take about 5 minutes. DO NOT walk or even glance away.
1. As soon as the butter has browned, add two-thirds of the marshmallows, the bourbon, vanilla, and salt. Cook for 5 to 6 minutes, stirring constantly. You are looking for smooth and glossy, golden color, and it should smell like caramel.
1. Turn off the heat. Add the remaining marshmallows and stir just until melted. Add the cereal and quickly stir to coat them. If your pot is not big enough, transfer to the largest mixing bowl you have.
1. Transfer into the prepared baking pan. With buttered or oiled hands, gently press into an even layer. Garnish with flaky salt.
1. Cool completely and cut into squares.
