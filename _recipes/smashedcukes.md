The recipe (link below) includes details about the preparation and a recipe and instructions to make your own chili oil. I cheat and use whatever I have on hand to approximate chili oil.

## Ingredients
- Cucumbers (small seeded like English or Persian, or slicing cukes with skin and seed removed) - 1 lb (-ish)
- Kosher salt - 1/4 to 1/2 tsp
- Minced or grated garlic - 3 cloves
- Rice vinegar - 2 T
- Soy sauce - 2 T
- Chili oil with spices - 2 T
- Sugar - 1 1/2 tsp
- Sesame oil - 2 tsp
- Toasted sesame seeds for garnish

## Directions
1. Slice cucumbers in half lengthwise. (If using Persian cukes, skip this step.)
1. With cut side down, smash the cucumbers with the side of your knife, as with garlic or olives. The cucumbers should split. 
1. Slice the cucumbers diagonally, about 1/2 inch thick and place in a non-reactive bowl.
1. Sprinkle the cucumbers with the kosher salt and mix.
1. Let the cucumbers sit for 20 minutes, then drain. You do not need to rinse the cukes. (If you have time, put the drained cucumbers in the fridge to chill and crisp up.)
1. While cucumbers are sitting or several minutes before serving, put the garlic and rice vinegar in a liquids measuring cup or a small bowl to mellow for 10-15 minutes.
1. To the garlic and vinegar, add the soy sauce, chili oil, sugar, and sesame oil.
1. Right before serving, toss the cucumber with the sauce and sprinkle with sesame seeds.
