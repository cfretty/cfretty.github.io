Instead of Cointreau, you can use O3 Orange Liqueur, Grand Marnier, or Dry Orange Curaçao.

Serve with my mother-in-law's guacamole and chips. Mother Joyce's guac: avocado, fresh squeezed lemon, coarse salt. That is all.

Makes four margaritas.

## Ingredients
- Fresh lime juice - .5 cup
- Cointreau - .5 cup
- Tequila, silver or strawberry jalapeño - 1 cup

## Directions
Pour over ice cubes in a shaker and shake until cold. Enjoy!

## Strawberry jalapeño tequila
_I generally make half this recipe._ Slice four pounds strawberries and four medium jalapeños (do not remove the seeds). Place in a five quart container. Use a tall pitcher or other sealable container (I use a glass pitcher, a crock pot works). Pour a large bottle of tequila (1.5 liter) over the berries and peppers and put a lid on it. Don't want the alcohol to evaporate! The tequila should cover the fruit and peppers. Keep the empty tequila bottle. Let it sit at room temperature for at least 24 hours. The berries will lose their color. Strain through a fine mesh sieve (do not press). Place the strained liquid back into the tequila bottle (use a funnel).
