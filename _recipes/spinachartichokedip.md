I found this dip while looking for a gluten-free, nut-free, less-bad-for-you dish to bring to a party. This one is a hard sell to anyone who isn't a vegan...if you tell them the ingredients. But if you just serve it, I bet folks would love it. I prefer this version over the greasy gut-bomb original. If you're intrigued at all, just try it.

Use jarred, marinated artichokes for best flavor.

Serve with rye or pumpernickel or fresh vegetables. It is especially good with zucchini rounds. 

## Ingredients
- Garlic, minced - 5 cloves
- Yellow onion, diced - ½
- Baby spinach, chopped - 4 cups
- Artichokes, chopped - 15 oz jar or frozen and thawed
- Cannellini (white kidney) beans, drained - 1 can
- Silken tofu, drained - 12 oz
- Nutritional yeast - ¼ cup (or more)
- Mayo or plain yogurt - 2 T (I used Hellman's, use vegan to make this dish vegan-friendly)
- Lemon, juiced - 1
- Parsley, freeze-dried - 1 tsp
- Garlic powder - 1 tsp
- Hot sauce, to taste - 2 or 3 dashes of Franks
- Black pepper, to taste
- Salt to taste (I didn't add any, the ingredients are quite salty)

## Directions
Add a bit of oil to a large heavy skillet and fry the onions and add the garlic on medium low until they are tender.

Add the artichokes and spinach and sauté for a few minutes until the spinach is wilted. Turn off the heat.

Add the remaining ingredients minus the hot sauce, pepper, and salt to a blender and purée until smooth and creamy. It will be a lot.

Pour the sauce into the skillet and turn the heat back on low, stirring to heat through. Taste the sauce and add hot sauce, and plenty of black pepper. You may find you don't need salt.

It is better if you let the flavors meld. Transfer to serving dish or a baking dish if you will reheat and serve it warm. I think it would be good topped with parmesan and placed under a broiler for a bit.

Serve warm or cold with chips, crackers, or crudités.
