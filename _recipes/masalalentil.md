Another good main or meal prep for cooler months, as this one uses year-round pantry staples. I usually have all ingredients on hand. It is especially lovely, though, with multicolored farmers market carrots.

## Dressing ingredients
- Olive oil - 3 T
- Garlic, pressed or grated - 1 clove
- Ginger, minced or grated - 1 tsp
- Garam masala - 1 tsp
- Apple cider vinegar - 2 T
- Salt - ¼ tsp
- Black pepper, fresh ground

## Dressing directions
Combine all the ingredients in a measuring cup. Whisk until evenly combined.

## Salad ingredients
- Carrots, peeled and sliced into ½ inch rounds - 1½ lbs
- Neutral vegetable oil - 2 T
- Maple syrup - 1 T
- Cumin - 1½ tsp
- Salt and fresh cracked pepper
- Beluga or French green lentils, dried - 1 cup (or 2 15oz cans, drained and rinsed)
- Red onion, finely chopped - ½ medium
- Baby arugula or kale - 2 cups
- Mint leaves, chopped - ⅓ cup
- Pomegranate molasses, optional
- Toasted pepitas, sunflower seeds, or pine nuts, optional

## Salad directions
Toss the carrots with the oil, maple syrup, and cumin. Place in a single layer on a lined baking sheet (you may need two). Season with salt a pepper and roast the carrots in a preheated 400-degree oven, about 40 minutes until fork-tender and browning.

Meanwhile, in a pot or Instant Pot, cook the lentils. On the stovetop, cover with water by 3 to 4 inches, boil, then simmer about 20-30 minutes. Drain, rinse under cold running water, then drain completely. Avoid overcooking them.

Place carrots and lentils in a large bowl and cool for 10 minutes. Add the onion, greens, and mint.

Pour the dressing over the salad and toss. Adjust seasonings. Optionally, drizzle with about 1 T of pomegranate molasses, serve toasted seeds on the side.
