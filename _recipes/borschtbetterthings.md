The soup of my people, zhuzhed for TV. Sam Fox is one of my favorite characters. This was a brilliant show.

## Ingredients
- Beef shanks, cubed - 3 or 4 (optional)
- Butter - 1/4 cup or 1/2 stick
- Beets peeled and cubed - 4 cups
- Beet, grated - 1
- Yellow onions, diced - 2
- Celery, diced - 1 head
- Green cabbage, chopped into bite size pieces - 1 medium
- Carrots, sliced into 1/4 inch coins - 2
- Carrot, grated - 1
- Garlic, roughly chopped - 8 cloves
- Tomatoes, diced - 1 can or 2 ish cups
- Tomato paste - 1 T (optional)
- Red wine vinegar - 1/4 cup
- Red table wine - 1/4 cup
- Beef or vegetable stock - 6 quarts (I use less, 6 to 8 cups)
- Oregano, fresh - 4 branches
- Bay leaves - 2
- Dill seeds - 1 T
- Small white potatoes, quartered - 5 small (optional)
- Maldon salt to taste
- Black pepper to taste
- Dill, fresh chopped (optional, to serve)
- Sour cream (optional, to serve)

## Directions
1. In a large soup pot, brown the beef shanks in butter. Get them very brown all over.
2. Remove the beef, leaving a little fat in the pan.
3. Add beets, onion, celery, cabbage, carrots, garlic, tomatoes, and tomato paste (if using) to the pot.
4. Saut√© the vegetables until they begin to brown.
5. Add the beef shanks back to the pot. Gingerly give everything a stir, you want the shanks to keep their shape while they're simmering.
6. Add vinegar and wine and stir until a little evaporation happens to the liquid.
7. Pour in the stock and add oregano, bay leaves, and dill seeds.
8. Bring the mixture to a boil. Once it starts to boil, turn it down to a simmer.
9. Simmer for 2 to 3 hours. If using potatoes, add them halfway through the simmer time.
10. Test the meat, it should be fork-tender.
11. Season the soup at the end with Maldon salt and coarse black pepper to taste.
12. Serve dressed with fresh dill and a dollop of sour cream.
