Serves 6-8. 

This is an easy one to make vegan. Use Thai red curry paste or use your favorite curry blend instead. 

This one can get sweet. Use the tartest apples possible. Taste before deciding whether to use honey.

## Ingredients
- Butternut squash, halved and seeded - ~ 4 lbs
- Olive oil or butter, room temperature, divided - 3 T
- Shallots, chopped - 1/2 cup
- Carrots, chopped - 1 cup
- Apples, cored, peeled, and chopped - 2 medium
- Thai red curry paste - 1 T or more to taste (see note above)
- Vegetable or chicken stock - 4 cups
- Hard cider - 1 cup
- Sweet cider - 1 cup
- Coconut milk or half and half - 1 cup
- Optional. Honey - 1-2 T or to taste
- Water if needed
- Salt and fresh ground pepper to taste
- Optional. Cilantro, chopped - 1/4 cup 

## Directions
1. Rub the cut sides of the squash with some oil or softened butter and place cut side down on a large rimmed baking sheet. Roast at 375 degrees F until tender, about 1 hour. Cool slightly and scoop out the flesh into a bowl and set aside.
1. In a large pot over medium-high heat, heat the remaining oil butter and add the shallot, carrots, and apples. Sauté, stirring occasionally until they begin to soften, about 3 minutes. 
1. Add the curry paste, then stir in the stock, both ciders, and the squash. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered. Stir occasionally until the apples and carrots are very soft, and the soup is thick, about 20 minutes.
1. Stir in the coconut milk or half and half. Using an immersion blender, purée the soup. Or blend in batches.
1. Add the honey and salt and pepper to taste. If it is too thick, add a little water. Stir in the chopped cilantro.
