The original recipe recommended fingerling potatoes, halved lengthwise, broccoli and cauliflower florets, carrots and celery sticks, and radishes, halved. I imagine the potatoes, blanched, are divine, but I ain't got time for that. I just serve with raw carrots and celery that I cut into nice, even sticks and crunchy crackers like Blue Diamond Nut-Thins.

## Ingredients
- Mixed olives such as Cerignola, kalamata, and Lucques, coarsely chopped - 1 cup
- Sour cream or greek yogurt - 1 cup
- Mayonnaise - 6 T
- Italian parsley, finely chopped - 1/4 cup
- Lemon juice, fresh - 5 tsp
- Garlic, minced - 2 medium cloves
- Dijon mustard - 1 tsp
- Kosher salt - t tsp

## Directions
Combine all the ingredients in a medium bowl. Mix until incorporated. Taste and season with fresh ground pepper.

Serve with crudités.
