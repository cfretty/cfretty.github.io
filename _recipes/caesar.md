Makes enough for three generous salads, approximately four side salads. This is half the original recipe, scale as needed.

## Ingredients
- Minced garlic - 1 small clove/1 tsp
- Anchovy paste - .5 tsp (optional)
- Lemon juice - 1 T
- Dijon mustard - .5 tsp
- Worcestershire sauce - .5 tsp
- Hellmann's or other quality mayo - .5 cup
- Salt and pepper to taste (salt sparingly, pepper generously)
- Optional. Parmigiano-Reggiano freshly grated - .25 cup

## Directions
Whisk together garlic, anchovy paste, lemon juice, Dijon, and Worcestershire. Blend in the mayo. Add a generous amount of fresh cracked pepper. Taste and salt, sparingly, if needed. Optionally, add cheese to the dressing. I prefer to add cheese to the salad instead.
