Reasonably healthy and visually stunning. Though traditional red beets are the most lovely, you can also make this with golden beets. If you can get picky eaters to try it, they are usually surprised at how good it tastes. IMO, raw beets with citrus juice are less earthy-tasting. Of course, freshness matters. This dip is much tastier with farmer's market beets and higher-quality olive oil.

I like to eat this for lunch in the summer. It keeps well in the fridge. Assemble the yogurt and dip at serving time.

## Ingredients
- Beets, well scrubbed, ends trimmed, roughly chopped (peel if you want, it's not necessary) - 1/2 lb (2 or 3 small, 1 or 2 medium)
- Almonds or walnuts, toasted in a dry skillet - 1 cup, plus extra for garnish
- Lemon or lime, zested for garnish and juiced - 3-4 T
- Pomegranate molasses, 1 T (I have subbed flavored Balsamic or Balsamic glaze)
- Crushed red pepper flakes - 1 tsp or to taste
- Garlic clove - 1
- Kosher salt - 1 tsp or to taste
- EVOO - 1/2 cup plus more for garnish
- Black pepper, fresh ground
- Greek yogurt or labneh for serving (Note: She recommends Fage 5% seasoned with a bit of salt and beaten with a spoon lighten the texture. This is what I use, since I always have Fage on hand.)
- Pita or chips
- Cucumbers or other veg

## Directions
1. Put first seven ingredients into a food processor and purée on high until beets and nuts are finely chopped. Scrape down the sides, blend again. Repeat until the mixture is very smooth. With almonds especially, it will never be totally smooth, but try to get it as close as possible.
1. Add the olive oil. Stream it in, blending and scraping down until the mixture is a mostly smooth purée. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt, pepper, more citrus juice, or pomegranate. Try upping the citrus juice and salt first.
1. Spoon the lightly beaten Greek yogurt or labneh into a bowl or onto a serving dish and smooth with the back of the spoon. Note: You do not have to spread all of it at once. Small plates are easier to store.
1. Spread the beet dip over the yogurt, leaving some yogurt around the edges and smoothing again.
1. Top with a generous drizzle of olive oil, sprinkle with the reserved zest and chopped or crushed nuts.
1. Serve with pita and cucumbers.
