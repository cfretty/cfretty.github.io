Back in the olden times I worked in an office building. In downtown St Paul, which has a reputation for being a ghost town. But in that one office building there were two coffee chains, a fast-casual chain, a higher-end fish, chop & steakhouse (with a scratch bar), a nouveau supper club, a record shop, and a convenience store. That's dead? I guess it's all relative.

Sorry for the digression. My point, I think, was I gobbled down too many lunches that were nutritional disasters, but there was a grab and go salad at the one chain coffee shop that was somewhat healthy. Of course, that could not stand, it was discontinued.

The original salad was brown rice with roasted butternut squash, beets, kale, red cabbage, steamed broccoli florets and peas. In late summer and fall, I use massaged kale, cabbage, roast squash or sweet potato, fresh grated beets, and pepitas or sunflower seeds and wild rice or brown rice. This is one of those dressings that would make an old shoe taste delicious, so use it on whatever veg or grains you have on hand.

## Dressing ingredients
- Tahini paste - ¼ cup
- Garlic, minced - 1 clove
- Lemon juice, fresh - ¼ cup
- Soy sauce or tamari - 1 T
- Agave syrup or maple syrup - ½ to 1 T
- Sriracha - ½ T

## Dressing directions
Whisk or blend until smooth.
