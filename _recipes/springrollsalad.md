This dressing is worth the long ingredient list. The veg base means it has an unusual texture, but the taste is surprisingly close to takeout sauce. This recipe makes 2 cups dressing, unless you can use it up quickly, half it. This salad is good for meal prep lunches.

## Dressing ingredients
- Carrots, peeled and rough chop - 4 medium
- Onion, rough chop - ½ medium
- Ginger, rough chop - 1½ T
- Rice vinegar - ½ cup
- Tamari or soy sauce - ¼ cup
- Peanut butter - 6 T
- Maple syrup - 3 T
- Avocado oil - 2 T
- Sriracha - ½ tsp
- Toasted sesame oil - 1 tsp
- Salt - ½ tsp

## Dressing directions
Blend until smooth.

## Salad ingredients
- Cabbage, shredded - 2½ cups
- Carrots, shredded - 1 cup
- Edamame, shelled and cooked - 1 cup
- Red bell pepper, finely chopped - 1
- Cucumber, finely chopped - 1 cup
- Cilantro - 1 cup
- Scallions - 1 cup
- Vermicelli rice noodles, cooked and cut into bite-sized lengths - 3 oz
- Nuts, roasted and chopped - ⅓ cup (Optional, diva's choice)
- Other optional additions: avocado, sesame seeds

## Salad directions
Cool the edamame a bit. Combine all but the nuts and avocado if using in one big-ass bowl that also has a lid. Toss with 1 cup of the dressing or pour over, cover, and shake.
