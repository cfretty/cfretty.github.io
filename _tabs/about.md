## *Hi. Charity Fretty. Damn glad to meet you.*
## About me
I live in Columbia Heights, a first-ring suburb of Minneapolis, MN.

My first full-time job out of college was technical writer. I love it. My focus has shifted content architecture, tools, and operations.

I am passionate about optimizing content for my audiences. I am also interested in content lifecycle. I collect best practices and tools to make the content we create simple and easy. Simple and pleasant to write, reuse, customize. Easy to translate, maintain, and present in all channels. I try to apply what I have learned about the software development lifecycle, agile, and cloud to information development.

Professionally and personally, the lodestar is an important symbol to me.

Minnesota born and raised, I have a special affection for l’etoile du nord and life on the 45th parallel north. In life, and in no particular order, I am:
- Wife, auntie, friend
- Housemate to a [big ginger cat](/assets/img/whiskey_tango_foxtrot.jpg)
- Homebody, gardener, above-average cook & mixologist
- Follower of Minnesota music & dining scenes
- Craft spirits, beer, & cider enthusiast
- Embracing my transition to crone

## About this site
As noted, I haven't been a full-time writer in a while. I want a personal portfolio with some up-to-date writing samples. I am also learning a bit about various techniques to create and maintain blogs.

Since I’m here, I will add posts on personal topics, hence northern miscellany.
